# Python source files

Source files for versions 2.5+ can be found in subdirectory 2

Source files for versions 3.x can be found in subdirectory 3

Note: The two pkl files, films.pkl and customers.pkl which can be found in both directories are specific to Python 2 and 3. Take care not to try to use the ones in the subdirectory 3 with the code in subdirectory 2 and vice versa.

Note: The source file pick.py which generates both films.pkl and customers.pkl can be found in both directories. You might like to use the code to enhance sample2.py by saving new customer and/or film information.
